```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- **Python:** 3.10 or later
- **[UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):** An extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust
- **Rippletide API Key:** Contact [patrick@rippletide.com](mailto:patrick@rippletide.com) or [yann@rippletide.com](mailto:yann@rippletide.com) to get your API key
  - The setup script will create your agent automatically
  - See the [Rippletide Getting Started guide](https://sdk.rippletide.com/documentation/get_started/) for more information
- **Blaxel Platform Setup:** Complete Blaxel setup by following the [quickstart guide](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started#quickstart)
  - **[Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/Get-started):** Ensure you have the Blaxel CLI installed. If not, install it globally:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh | BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
    ```
  - **Blaxel login:** Login to Blaxel platform
    ```bash
    bl login
    ```

## 💻 Installation

**Clone the repository and install dependencies:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blaxel-ai/template-rippletide-customer-support.git
cd template-rippletide-customer-support
uv sync
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Step 1: Get Your Rippletide API Key

Contact [patrick@rippletide.com](mailto:patrick@rippletide.com) or [yann@rippletide.com](mailto:yann@rippletide.com) to get your Rippletide API key.

Once you have your API key, create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Step 2: Customize Your Knowledge Base

The `knowledge-base/` folder contains sample customer support data. Customize these files for your business:

- **tags.json** - Categories for organizing your knowledge (e.g., "shipping_delivery", "returns_refunds")
- **qanda.json** - Question-answer pairs that form your agent's knowledge base
- **state_predicate.json** - Conversation flow and decision tree

See the [knowledge-base/README.md](knowledge-base/README.md) for detailed information on customizing each file.

### Step 3: Run the Setup Script

The setup script will create your agent in Rippletide with all the configurations from the knowledge-base folder:

```bash
uv run src/setup.py
```

The script will:
1. ✅ Create a customer support agent in Rippletide
2. ✅ Set up all tags from tags.json
3. ✅ Add Q&A pairs from qanda.json (with tag associations)
4. ✅ Set up conversation flow from state_predicate.json
5. ✅ Provide you with an Agent ID

### Step 4: Add Agent ID to Environment

After running the setup script, add the generated Agent ID to your `.env` file:

```env
RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
RIPPLETIDE_AGENT_ID=your-agent-id-here
```

## 🔧 Usage

### Running Locally

Start the development server with hot reloading:

```bash
bl serve --hotreload
```

For production run:

```bash
bl serve
```

_Note:_ The development server automatically restarts when you make changes to the source code.

### Testing

You can test your customer support agent locally:

```bash
# Using the Blaxel CLI chat interface
bl chat --local template-rippletide-customer-support
```

Example customer support queries you can test:

```
I haven't received my order confirmation email. Can you help?
```

```
What is your return policy for products purchased online?
```

```
How can I track my order?
```

```
I need to update my billing address. How do I do that?
```

You can also run it directly with specific input:

```bash
bl run agent rippletide-support-agent --local --data '{"inputs": "What are your business hours?"}'
```

### Deployment

When you are ready to deploy your customer support agent:

```bash
bl deploy
```

This command uses your code and the configuration files under the `.blaxel` directory to deploy your customer support agent on the Blaxel platform. Once deployed, your agent will be available to handle customer inquiries through your configured channels.

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Setup Script Issues**:
   - Ensure `RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY` is set in your `.env` file before running `setup.py`
   - Check that all JSON files in `knowledge-base/` are valid (use a JSON validator)
   - If setup fails partially, you may need to delete the agent in Rippletide and run setup again
   - Review the colored console output for specific error messages

2. **Rippletide Integration Issues**:
   - Verify your Rippletide API key is valid and active
   - Ensure your agent ID is correct and the agent is properly configured
   - Check that your knowledge base is populated with relevant information
   - Review the Rippletide dashboard for agent status and logs
   - Confirm API endpoint connectivity: `https://agent.rippletide.com/api/sdk`

3. **Blaxel Platform Issues**:
   - Ensure you're logged in to your workspace: `bl login`
   - Verify models are available: `bl get models`
   - Check that functions exist: `bl get functions`
   - Review Blaxel logs for deployment or runtime errors

4. **Agent Response Issues**:
   - Verify your agent's system prompt is clear and specific
   - Check knowledge base coverage for common customer queries
   - Review guardrails configuration for compliance requirements
   - Monitor response accuracy and hallucination metrics in Rippletide dashboard

5. **Python Environment Issues**:
   - Make sure you have Python 3.10+
   - Try `uv sync --upgrade` to update dependencies
   - Check for conflicting package versions
   - Verify virtual environment activation with UV
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set

6. **Conversation Context Issues**:
   - Check that conversation UUIDs are being properly tracked
   - Verify conversation history is maintained across messages
   - Review conversation flow in Rippletide dashboard
